How do I approach designing software?
my approach to designing software is preparation and execution.  It isn't as simple as walking up to a monitor and begin typing. We need to come in with a game plan and follow through it.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new skills I've learned is computer, graphics, creation, and a better appreciation for C++.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed is a simple preparation before hand and charts that illustrate the flow of data. With the aid of three dimensional graphs visible, I was able to design my computer graphics with coordinates.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Tactics from my design can be applied for future work by creating a plan. Thinking every step all the way through will create more efficient and faster work completed.
How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs the same as building a house of cards. One wrong move or step, and everything will collapse.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The new development strategies are used while working on the  3-D scene were an artistic and creative approach.  Functionality was one part of this program, but creating an artistic space and area to build upon  was the main goal.
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was used to repeat, textures or create more unique shapes that would cost a lot of time if done from scratch.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
each mile stone created a new challenge that needed to be overcome. And computer science can help me reach my goals by giving me the skills needed to enter the workforce and provide for myself. Computer graphics have shown a new perspective of programming that was fun to learn. I have gained a new appreciation.
